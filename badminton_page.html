               <p class="badmintonPara"> Badminton is more than a hobby for me. Introduced to the sport when I was seven, I have been playing it for five years now, and my hardwork has brought results.
                I'm a state badminton player, and have always strived to give my best during the match. Badminton gives me an opportunity to stay fit and hone my observation skills, because 
                it is crucial that we understand the game style of the opponent in the first few points in the match.
